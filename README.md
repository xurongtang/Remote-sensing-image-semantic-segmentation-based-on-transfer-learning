# Remote-image-segmentation-based-on-transfer-learning
Identify the colored steel houses along the railway to ensure the safety of railway operation. However, since there are fewer colored steel house datasets and a large number of remote sensing image data building datasets, we now train on the building dataset and then use transfer learning to fine-tune on the colored steel house dataset.
